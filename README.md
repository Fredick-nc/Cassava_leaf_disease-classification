In this project, we construct seven models in total, which are InceptionNetV2, VGG19, MobileNetV2, CNN, EfficientNetB3, EfficientNetB5, EfficientNetB7. And we install tensorflow (version 2.11) virtual environment and use keras packages in tensorflow to implement these models. We use three devices to run these code, Apple M1 pro, GPU 3060ti and Kaggle competition platform with GPU T4x2 and GPU P100.
